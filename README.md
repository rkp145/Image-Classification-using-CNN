 CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

This project implements image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in TensorFlow. The model is trained to classify images into 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

 Features

- Data Preprocessing: Normalized image data to lie between 0 and 1.
- Visualization: Plots sample images with class labels.
- Model Architecture: 
  - Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Initial basic model with dense layers.
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Improved model with convolutional and pooling layers.
- Training and Evaluation: Trained models with CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.



 Dependencies
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
